# Chatters - Chat App

Chatters is a chat-social application inspired by Facebook and Messenger. It has a simple and intuitive interface. Create an account. Invite friends, write with them, edit your profile, post on the dashboard.

# Features

## ℹ️ Basic concept

Chatters is primarily intended to provide dynamic conversations with other users. At the same time, allowing them to use other options, such as inviting friends or creating posts.

## 📌 Create an account

Thanks to the use of Firebase, the user can create an account in two ways. Use the classic method of entering your email and password. Or faster - log in directly through your Google account. However, with the first method, he must confirm his account by clicking the activation link in his email.

## 🗺️ Dashboard

In the dashboard section, users can insert their posts. At the same time, they can share files and choose from the entire range of gifs that Giphy has to offer

## 🗺️ Profiles

Each user has their own profile. This is where we will find his friends and information about him. Such as personal data, description or social media. We can modify the information. Insert your own avatars or background images. However, you can remove and add friends.
